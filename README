Need to run start_run.sh to kind of "init" ML program, otherwise it can not start correctly, don't understand why this happens


Temporarily exp are designed as follows: resource = CPU
Ex1: One sim with all resource, then one ml with all resource
Ex2: One sim with some resource, then one ml with some other resource
Ex3: One sim with some resource, together with one ml with some other resource


When comparing different exp, make sure data reading is not affecting much!
